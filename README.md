# **Support Vector Machine - Project**

Work done by Elie PICAUD and Lo√Øc PALMA for the Autumn 2019 class of Big Data Analytics: Support Vector Machine at ESA Master's degree. The instructor was [Christophe Hurlin](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/deg/masters/ESA/CH/churlin.htm).

The datasets used in this project is **FREE** and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).


# **Content**

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
