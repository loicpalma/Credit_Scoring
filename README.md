# **Support Vector Machine - Project**

Work done by Loïc PALMA and Mickaël WALTER for the Winter 2019 class of Scoring Methods at ESA Master's degree. The instructor was [Chritophe Rault](http://chrault3.free.fr/).

The datasets used in this project is **CONFIDENTIAL* hence we do not provide them.

The purpose of this project covering the Scoring Methods course teached in Master ESA is to put in thevarious concepts discussed in class, particularly those relating on credit scoring. This project is sponsored byRCI Bank & Services (Renault Credit International), a 100% subsidiary of Renault SA, which specializes incar financing and the distribution of related services. RCI Bank & Services supports the strategic developmentof sales of the Renault-Nissan Alliance brands and helps to win and retain Alliance brand clients by providingfinancing and related services. More precisely, the main missions of RCI Bank & Services are the developmentof internal credit risk models (Basel III, stress test) as well as scoring and the methodology of provisioning(credit risk scores, Marketing, IFRS9). They are the one providing the dataset. Our project aim to constructand develop a credit score. We will have to use a logistic regression and two machine learning algorithms inorder to benchmark them with each other. In order to compare our models, the Gini and 10/X indices will beused. Due to obvious confidentiality reasons, the dataset could not be shared, as it is RCI Bank & Services’data.
